## Sample Letter

Hello Rep. Kyrsten!

RE: HR 3530 Rep. Comer, James [R-KY-1] Federal Hemp Bill

Why not jump on board with (15) of your fellow US Representatives and help co-sponsor HR 3530, the Federal Hemp bill?

Your own state legislature of Arizona, which you were once part of, in BOTH houses, passed a Hemp bill unanimously in the az state senate and with only 3 dissenters in the entire az state house!

That vote took place in May #2017.

For a review of Arizona's vote **For** hemp ... C=> [SB 1337: The Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017](https://rwebaz.github.io/Hemp/Arizona-Hemp.htm){:target="_blank"}

Too bad our "Pastor" in chief Doug Douchey vetoed their bi-partisan effort.

We'll deal with that in August of #2018.

In the interim, please join the (15) federal representatives who are co-sponsoring **HR 3530** in an effort to help pass **The Federal Hemp Act of 2017** through the US House of Representatives, and then send the bill on over to the US Senate for additional consideration.

Please work with the bill co-sponsors to ensure **HR 3530** will give states the authority to regulate their own hemp production and distillation efforts.

Thank you!

Sincerely,

Robert ...

Hello Ya All ...!

Our State Hemp bill in Arizona ( SB 1337 ) got VETOED by our "Pastor" in chief, Doug Douchey after passing both the state senate and the state house with overwhelming flying colors.

Now, Rep. Comer of Kentucky has entered a hemp bill on the floor of the Federal House of Representatives under **HR 3530**.

Looks promising.

Contact your Fed Rep today and encourage them to say **YES** on **HB 3530**, The Federal Hemp Act of 2017.

Thx, Robert.
